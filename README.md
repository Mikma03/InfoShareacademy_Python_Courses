# InfoShareacademy_Python_Courses

As a result of participating in InfoShare courses about Python those are codes and algorithms done during classes.

The full range of topics and the entire course can be found on the [website](https://www.infoshareacademy.online/):

The whole things are divided into three parts:

  1. **Beginner - intro to Python, data structure and main concepts as functions**

  2. **Intermediate - OOP in Python**

  3. **Advanced**

The three parts have been thought out and planned in such a way to introduce you to the world of programming from scratch and end at an advanced level.

During the course, PyCharm was used as an IDE.

The folders contain codes and the scope of the issues to be implemented.
