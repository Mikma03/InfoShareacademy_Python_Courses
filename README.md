# Introduction to this repository

<p>&nbsp;</p>

As a result of participating in InfoShare courses about Python those are codes and algorithms done during classes.

The full range of topics and the entire course can be found on the [Infoshare website](https://www.infoshareacademy.online/):

The whole things are divided into three main parts:


  1. **Beginner** - **intro to Python, data structure and main concepts as functions, loops etc**

  2. **Intermediate** - **OOP in Python and Python environment plus workflow**

  3. **Advanced** - **Andvanced OOP & metaclasses & generators**


The three parts have been thought out and planned in such a way to introduce you to the world of programming from scratch and end at an advanced level.

During the course, PyCharm was used as an IDE.

The folders contain codes and the scope of the issues to be implemented.
